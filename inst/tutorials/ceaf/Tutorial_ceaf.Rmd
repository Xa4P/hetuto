## Cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF)

### Aims
This assignment aims to familiarise you with the concept of the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF), by constructing one yourself, based on a fictive example. The aim of this assignment is to identify which of the screening strategies is the most cost effective.  

### Instructions
The provided solutions are one way to perform the calculations. You can obtain the same results using other fomula's or R commands. The last 'Hint' is always the solution to the assignment. Solutions can be copied and pasted in the chunk as shown in the figures below. Once you have completed a code chunk, you can run it by clicking the 'Run code' button on the upper-right side of the chunk or using the shortcut CRTL+Enter.    

```{r, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "70%", echo = F}

### The data
The assignment uses the `df_thx` object, which is already loaded in this tutorial. 

The `df_thx` object contains 4 variables and 9 observations (the outcomes of the strategies to compare):  

- `Strategy` = the number identifying the screening strategy  
- `Name` = the name of the screening strategy  
- `Costs` = the total costs of the screening strategy    
- `QALYs` = the total QALYs gained through the screening strategy 

The `df_thx` object is displayed herebelow. Have a look at this dataframe before starting the assignment.

```{r show_data}
df_thx
```

The graph below displays the strategies in a cost-effectiveness plane.
```{r show_data_plot}
ggplot(data = df_thx, aes(x = QALYs, Costs, colour = Strategy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey") +
  ggtitle("Cost-effectiveness plane") +
  theme_bw()

```

### Assignment and questions
Calculate the fully incremental ICERs of these screening strategies against each other and answer the questions below.     
**To do so, you can use a pen, paper, and calculator and use the method described in the paper from [Paulden](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-020-00914-6) OR you can follow this tutorial. The answers to these questions are at the end of this tutorial.**  
1. Which strategies are dominated?  
2. Which strategies are extendedly dominated?  
3. Which strategies are on the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier?  
4. Which strategy is optimal if the WTP threshold is equal to €20,000/QALY?  
5. Which strategy is optimal if the WTP threshold is equal to €40,000/QALY?  
6. Which strategy is optimal if the WTP threshold is equal to €100,000/QALY?  
7. At which WTP threshold would strategy 4 be the optimal strategy?  
8. At which WTP threshold would strategy 7 be the optimal strategy?  
9.	Calculate the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) for each strategy for a WTP threshold of €20,000/QALY. Which strategy has the highest NMB? Does this correspond with your answer to question 4?  

### Step 1: order the strategies by increasing total QALYs
```{r order, echo = TRUE}
df_thx <- df_thx[order(df_thx$QALYs),]
df_thx
```

### Step 2: identify the dominated strategies
```{r quiz_dominated}
question("Based on the table where strategies are ordered by increasing total number of QALYs, which strategy is dominated?",
  answer("Strategy 1"),
  answer("Strategy 2"),
  answer("Strategy 3"),
  answer("Strategy 4", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Strategy 5"),
  answer("Strategy 6"),
  answer("Strategy 7"),
  answer("Strategy 8"),
  answer("Strategy 9"),
  answer("None")
)
```

Can you explain why this (these) strategy(ies) are dominated?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
textInput("Answer_1", "Enter your answer")
```

### Explanation answer Step 2
Strategy 4 is dominated by Strategy 1 because Strategy 1 provides more health benefits (QALYs) at a lower costs.  

### Step 3: Calculate ICERs
Since strategy 4 is dominated, it will not be used further in the comparison of the strategies. It is now time to calculate the different ICERs.  
```{r}
df_thx <- df_thx[order(df_thx$QALYs),]
rownames(df_thx) <- NULL
df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy !=4), ]
```

Calculate the ICERs of strategies 3, 2, 5, 7, 6, 9, 8. You can use a calculator or the R code chunk below to calculate them. Round your results to the closest euro and write your answers. **DO NOT FORGET THAT THE ICER OF A SPECIFIC STRATEGY HAS TO BE CALCULATED AGAINST THE NEXT BEST STRATEGY!**  
Check your answers by clicking on 'Continue'!

```{r calc_icers_1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r calc_icers_1-hint}
"Example: The ICER of strategy 3 is obtained by 1) calculating the difference in costs between strategy 3 and 1, 2) calculating the difference in QALYs between strategy 3 and 1, and 3) dividing the difference in costs by the difference in QALYs. Strategy 3 is compared with strategy 1 because strategy 1 is the first non-(extendedly) dominated strategy above 3."
```

```{r calc_icers_1-solution}
# EXAMPLE: ICER of 3 versus 1
diff_costs <- df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 3), "Costs"] - df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 1), "Costs"] # difference in costs between strategy 3 and 1
diff_effects <- df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 3), "QALYs"] - df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 1), "QALYs"] # difference in effects between strategy 3 and 1

icer <- diff_costs / diff_effects # ratio of the difference in costs by the difference in effect
icer_rounded <- round(icer) # rounding off
icer_rounded # shows results
```

```{r calc_icers_user}
textInput("icer_3", "ICER of strategy 3", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_2", "ICER of strategy 2", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_5", "ICER of strategy 5", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_7", "ICER of strategy 7", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_6", "ICER of strategy 6", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_9", "ICER of strategy 9", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_8", "ICER of strategy 8", width = "300px")
```

### Step 3: Explanations
The results in the table below are obtained by calculating the difference in costs and effects between consecutive strategies in the table.
```{r calc_icer1}
df_thx <- df_thx[order(df_thx$QALYs),]
rownames(df_thx) <- NULL
df_thx2 <- df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy !=4), ]
ICER <- format(round(c(0, diff(df_thx2$Costs)) / c(0, diff(df_thx2$QALYs))), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)
ICER[1] <- "-"
df_thx2 <- cbind(df_thx2, ICER)
df_thx2
```

### Step 4: Identify extendedly dominated strategies
Based on the table above, we can now identify the extendedly dominated strategies!
```{r quiz_ext_dom}
quiz(
question("Based on the table above, which strategy(ies) is(are) extendedly dominated? ",
  answer("Strategy 1"),
  answer("Strategy 2", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Strategy 3"),
  answer("Strategy 5"),
  answer("Strategy 6", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Strategy 7"),
  answer("Strategy 8"),
  answer("Strategy 9"),
  answer("None"),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  try_again = "Did you select all the correct answers?"
  )
)
```

Can you explain your answer?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
textInput("Answer_2", "Enter your answer")
```

### Step 4: Explanations
Strategies 2 and 6 are extendedly dominated because their ICER is greater than the strategy below them in the table. Strategy 2 is **extendedly dominated** by strategies 3 and 5 because, in theory, it may possible to screen some individuals following strategy 3 and some other individuals following strategy 5, which would results in costs and benefits which dominate strategy 2 (the ICER of the combination of strategies 3 and 5 would be lower than the ICER of strategy 2). Thus strategy 2 is not extendedly dominated by a single strategy but by the combination of 3 and 5. The same applies to strategy 6, when considering strategy 7 and 9.

### Step 5: Re-calculate ICERs and identify extendedly dominated strategies
Now, ICERs have to be recalculated since strategies 2 and 6 have been ruled out of the comparison. Calculate the ICERs of strategies 3, 5, 7, 9, 8. You can use a calculator or the R code chunk below to calculate them. Round your results to the closest euro and write your answers. Check your answers by clicking on 'Continue'!
```{r}
df_thx <- df_thx[order(df_thx$QALYs),]
rownames(df_thx) <- NULL
df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy != 4 &
               df_thx$Strategy != 2 &
               df_thx$Strategy != 6), ]
```

```{r calc_icers_2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r calc_icers_2-solution}
# EXAMPLE: ICER of 3 versus 1
diff_costs <- df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 3), "Costs"] - df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 1), "Costs"] # difference in costs between strategy 3 and 1
diff_effects <- df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 3), "QALYs"] - df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 1), "QALYs"] # difference in effects between strategy 3 and 1

icer <- diff_costs / diff_effects # ratio of the difference in costs by the difference in effect
icer_rounded <- round(icer) # rounding off
icer_rounded # shows results
```

```{r calc_icers_user2}
textInput("icer_3b", "ICER of strategy 3", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_5b", "ICER of strategy 5", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_7b", "ICER of strategy 7", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_9b", "ICER of strategy 9", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_8b", "ICER of strategy 8", width = "300px")
```

### Step 5: Explanations
The results in the table below are obtained by calculating the difference in costs and effects between consecutive strategies in the table
```{r calc_icer2}
df_thx <- df_thx[order(df_thx$QALYs),]
rownames(df_thx) <- NULL
df_thx2 <- df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy != 4 &
               df_thx$Strategy != 2 &
               df_thx$Strategy != 6), ]
ICER <- format(round(c(0, diff(df_thx2$Costs)) / c(0, diff(df_thx2$QALYs))), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)
ICER[1] <- "-"
df_thx2 <- cbind(df_thx2, ICER)
df_thx2
```

### Step 5: Identify extendedly dominated strategies
Based on the table above, we can now identify the extendedly dominated strategies!
```{r quiz_ext_dom2}
quiz(
question("Based on the table above, which strategy(ies) is (are) extendedly dominated?",
  answer("Strategy 1"),
  answer("Strategy 3"),
  answer("Strategy 5", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Strategy 7"),
  answer("Strategy 8"),
  answer("Strategy 9"),
  answer("None"),
  type = "learnr_radio",
  incorrect = "The right answer is strategy 5, see the explanation to the previous step.",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
)
```

### Step 6: Re-calculate ICERs and identify extendedly dominated strategies
Now, ICERs have to be recalculated since strategies 2, 5, and 6 have been ruled out of the comparison. Calculate the ICERs of strategies 3, 7, 9, 8. You can use a calculator or the R code chunk below to calculate them. Round your results to the closest euro and write your answers. Check your answers by clicking on 'Continue'!
```{r}
df_thx <- df_thx[order(df_thx$QALYs),]
rownames(df_thx) <- NULL
df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy != 4 &
               df_thx$Strategy != 2 &
               df_thx$Strategy != 6 &
               df_thx$Strategy != 5), ]
```

```{r calc_icers_3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r calc_icers_3-solution}
# EXAMPLE: ICER of 3 versus 1
diff_costs <- df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 3), "Costs"] - df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 1), "Costs"] # difference in costs between strategy 3 and 1
diff_effects <- df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 3), "QALYs"] - df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy == 1), "QALYs"] # difference in effects between strategy 3 and 1

icer <- diff_costs / diff_effects # ratio of the difference in costs by the difference in effect
icer_rounded <- round(icer) # rounding off
icer_rounded # shows results
```

```{r calc_icers_user3}
textInput("icer_3c", "ICER of strategy 3", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_7c", "ICER of strategy 7", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_9c", "ICER of strategy 9", width = "300px")
textInput("icer_8c", "ICER of strategy 8", width = "300px")
```

### Step 6: Explanations
The results in the table below are obtained by calculating the difference in costs and effects between consecutive strategies in the table
```{r calc_icer3}
df_thx <- df_thx[order(df_thx$QALYs),]
rownames(df_thx) <- NULL
df_thx3 <- df_thx[which(df_thx$Strategy != 4 &
               df_thx$Strategy != 2 &
               df_thx$Strategy != 6 &
                 df_thx$Strategy != 5), ]
ICER <- format(round(c(0, diff(df_thx3$Costs)) / c(0, diff(df_thx3$QALYs))), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)
ICER[1] <- "-"
df_thx3 <- cbind(df_thx3, ICER)
df_thx3
```

### Step 6: Identify extendedly dominated strategies
Based on the table above, we can now identify the extendedly dominated strategies!
```{r quiz_ext_dom3}
quiz(
question("Based on the table above, which strategy(ies) is(are) extendedly dominated? ",
  answer("Strategy 1"),
  answer("Strategy 3"),
  answer("Strategy 7"),
  answer("Strategy 8"),
  answer("Strategy 9"),
  answer("None", correct = TRUE),
  type = "learnr_radio",
  incorrect = "Too bad... The right answer is that none of these strategies are extendedly dominated since all ICERs are increasing! Strategies 1, 3, 7, 8, 9 are thus all on the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier!",
  correct = "Good job! This means that strategies 1, 3, 7, 8, 9 are all on the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier!",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
)
```

### Using Net Monetary Benefits
Calculate the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) for each intervention for a WTP threshold of €20,000/QALY. Store the NMBs in a column called `NMB` in the `df_thx` dataframe.  

```{r calc_nmb, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r calc_nmb-hint}
"The NMB of each strategy is calculated by multiplying the number of QALY of each intervention by the WTP threshold and then substracting the costs of each intervention."
```

```{r calc_nmb-solution}
df_thx$NMB <- df_thx$QALYs * 20000 - df_thx$Costs
df_thx # shows results
```

### Using Net Monetary Benefits - question
The table below shows the correct results. You can use it to check your answer.  

```{r nmb}
df_thx$NMB <- as.numeric(as.character(df_thx$QALYs)) * 20000 - as.numeric(as.character(df_thx$Costs))
df_thx <- df_thx[order(df_thx$Strategy),]
df_thx # shows results
```
