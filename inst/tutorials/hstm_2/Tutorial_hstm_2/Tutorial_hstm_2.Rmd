## Before starting
1. Watch the videos explaining how a Health State Transition Model (HSTM) works and can be used for a cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA), and on uncertainty assessment. To do so, you probably need to open open the tutorial in your browser using the 'Open in Browser' button on the upper left side of the screen.

## Aim and instructions
The aim of this practical assignment is to get you acquainted with the principle of HSTM. This assignmment focuses on evaluating the cost-effectiveness of aspirin treatment versus no aspirin treatment for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events using a HSTM, also called Markov model. During this assignment, you will first define the cohort simulation of both strategies (using transition probabilities, and matrix multiplication) and then calculate the outcomes (quality-adjusted life years, costs). First, familiarise yourself with the model structure.  
The method described in this practical is more extensively described in [Alarid Escudero et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07824).  

```{r, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "70%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("Tutorial_hstm_2_files/images/Image_hint.png")
```

```{r, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "70%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("Tutorial_hstm_2_files/images/Image_solution.png")
```

### Prerequisites
You should be able to use the following commands to perform this exercise:  

- `which()` function  
- `matrix()` and `array()` functions  
- `rowSums()` function
- perform matrix multiplication using `%*%`  
- using the command `for()` to perform forward loop  

## Model structure & parameters  
**DISCLAIMER: FOR THE FOLLOWING ASSIGNMENT, ASSUME THAT PROBABILITIES ARE THE SAME AS RATES. SEE *[Fleurence & Hollenbeak 2007]*(https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200725010-00002) FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RATES AND PROBABILITIES AND REMEMBER THAT WE USUALLY USE PROBABILITIES IN HEALTH ECONOMIC MODELLING** 

### Model structure
In this HSTM, individuals either receive aspirin or not (the two strategies we compare).In this model, individuals may remain "Well", or they can experience a stroke or a myocardial infarction (MI). These two events may be fatal or individuals may remain alive in the "Post-minor stroke", "Post-major stroke", or "Post-MI" health states when they survive these events. From all health states, individuals may die from general causes of death to "Death other".  
  
```{r, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "90%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("Tutorial_hstm_2_files/images/Fig_model_structure.png")
```

### Model inputs
As you can see both strategies (prescribing aspirin or not) have similar diagrams. However, there will be differences in the values of the parameters applied in these strategies. First, we will focus on the disease progression of patients not using aspirin. Have a look at the input parameters which are already defined herebelow.   

```{r inputs_gen, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Setting parameters
n_cycles <- 10 # number of cycles in the health economic model
r_d_effects <- 0.015 # annual discount rate, health effects
r_d_costs <- 0.04 # annual discount rate, costs
v_names_hs <- c("Well", "Post-minor_stroke", "Post-major_stroke", "Post-MI", "Death_stroke", "Death_MI", "Death_other") # vector of names of health states
n_hs <- length(v_names_hs) # number of health states
n_ind <- 100000 # number of individuals to simulate  
v_start_hs <- c(n_ind, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) # vector of starting position in the model  

# Input parameters

## Rates & probabilities
r_fatal_mi	<- 0.25 # rate fatal MI - no-Aspirin strategy
r_fatal_stroke	<- 0.3 # rate fatal stroke - no-Aspirin strategy

## Treatment effectiveness
eff_mi	<- 0.6 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a MI
eff_stroke	<- 1.2 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a stroke

## Utility values 
u_healthy	<- 1 # utility value health state: Well
u_post_mi	<- 0.85 # utility value health state: Post-MI
u_post_minor_stroke	<- 0.75 # utility value health state: Post-minor stroke
u_post_major_stroke	<- 0.5 # utility value health state: Post-major stroke
u_aspirin_use	<- 0.999 # utility value health state: Well when using aspiring

## Costs
c_aspirin_use	<- 100 # yearly costs of using aspirin
c_post_mi	<- 8000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL MI
c_post_minor_stroke	<- 2000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL minor stroke
c_post_major_stroke	<- 20000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON_FATAL major stroke
```


When developing a health economic model we often have to combine evidence from different sources of literature. Assume that there was evidence that 235 out of 1,000 patients **who had a stroke and survived** moved into a post major stroke state (the remaining patients experienced a minor stroke). Based on this evidence, please define the parameter `p_minor_stroke` (probability of transiting to the "post-minor stroke" health state **after having experienced a NON-FATAL stroke** and `p_major_stroke` (probability of transiting to the "post-major stroke" health state **after having experienced a NON-FATAL stroke**.   
1.b. From other sources, you found that the incidence rates for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and death from other causes were respectively **400, 50, and 650 per 100,000 person-years**. Calculate the yearly incidence rates of MI, stroke, and death from other causes than MI and stroke in the placeholder of parameters `r_inc_mi`, `r_inc_stroke`, and `r_mort`.  

```{r calc_inputs, exercise = TRUE}
# Parameters to calculate
# probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
# probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
# yearly incidence rate MI
# yearly incidence rate stroke
# yearly rate of death
```

```{r calc_inputs-hint}
# Example
p_post_major_stroke	<- 235 / 1000 # probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
p_post_minor_stroke	<- 1 - p_post_major_stroke # probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
```

```{r calc_inputs-solution}
p_post_major_stroke	<- 235 / 1000 # probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
p_post_minor_stroke	<- 1 - p_post_major_stroke # probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
r_inc_mi <- 400 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate MI
r_inc_stroke <- 50 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate stroke
r_mort <- 650 / 100000 # yearly rate of death
#data.frame(c(p_post_major_stroke, p_post_minor_stroke, r_inc_mi, r_inc_stroke, r_mort)) # show
```

## Transition matrices - "No aspirin" 

### Define the transition matrix of the "No aspirin" strategy  
The input parameter values looks as follows now. Based on these parameter values, determine the transition matrix of the "No aspirin" strategy, and call it `m_tp_comp` (for matrix transition probabilities of the comparator). Assume here that `r_mort` can be used for the probability of ‘Death other’.  

```{r inputs_complete_setup, echo = TRUE}
# Setting parameters
n_cycles <- 10 # number of cycles
r_d_effects <- 0.015 # annual discount rate, health effects
r_d_costs <- 0.04 # annual discount rate, costs
v_names_hs <- c("Well", "Post-minor_stroke", "Post-major_stroke", "Post-MI", "Death_stroke", "Death_MI", "Death_other") # vector of names of health states
n_hs <- length(v_names_hs) # number of health states
n_ind <- 100000 # number of individuals to simulate  
v_start_hs <- c(n_ind, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) # vector of starting position in the model  

# Input parameters

## Rates & probabilities
r_fatal_mi	<- 0.25 # rate fatal MI
r_fatal_stroke	<- 0.3 # rate fatal stroke

## Treatment effectiveness
eff_mi	<- 0.6 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a MI
eff_stroke	<- 1.2 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a stroke

## Utility values 
u_healthy	<- 1 # utility value health state: Well
u_post_mi	<- 0.85 # utility value health state: Post-MI
u_post_minor_stroke	<- 0.75 # utility value health state: Post-minor stroke
u_post_major_stroke	<- 0.5 # utility value health state: Post-major stroke
u_aspirin_use	<- 0.999 # utility value health state: Well when using aspiring

## Costs
c_aspirin_use	<- 100 # yearly costs of using aspiring
c_post_mi	<- 8000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL MI
c_post_minor_stroke	<- 2000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL minor stroke
c_post_major_stroke	<- 20000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON_FATAL major stroke

## Calculated parameters
p_post_major_stroke	<- 235 / 1000 # probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
p_post_minor_stroke	<- 1 - p_post_major_stroke # probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
r_inc_mi <- 400 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate MI
r_inc_stroke <- 50 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate stroke
r_mort <- 650 / 100000 # yearly rate of death
```

```{r m_tp_1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "inputs_complete_setup"}


```

```{r m_tp_1-hint-1}
"To do so, create a matrix of 7 by 7, and use the evidence `p_` and `r_` parameters to fill it in. Use the model structure to fill in the transition matrix. Once an individuals die, that person remains in that health state. The transition probabilities to the post-minor stroke health states are the product of experiencing a non-fatal stroke and of the consequences being minor or major."
```

```{r m_tp_1-hint-2}
# Create transition matrix
m_tp_comp <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = n_hs,
                    nrow = n_hs,
                    dimnames = list(from = v_names_hs,
                                    to = v_names_hs)
                    )
# Fill in transition matrix
m_tp_comp["Well", "Well"] <- 1 - r_inc_mi - r_inc_stroke - r_mort # example
```

```{r m_tp_1-solution}
# Create transition matrix
m_tp_comp <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = n_hs,
                    nrow = n_hs,
                    dimnames = list(from = v_names_hs,
                                    to = v_names_hs)
                    )
# Fill in transition matrix
m_tp_comp["Well", "Well"] <- 1 - r_inc_mi - r_inc_stroke - r_mort 
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-minor_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_minor_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-major_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_major_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-MI"] <- r_inc_mi * (1 - r_fatal_mi)
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * r_fatal_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_MI"] <- r_inc_mi * r_fatal_mi
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Post-minor_stroke"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-major_stroke", "Post-major_stroke"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-major_stroke", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-MI", "Post-MI"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-MI", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Death_stroke", "Death_stroke"] <- 1
m_tp_comp["Death_MI", "Death_MI"] <- 1
m_tp_comp["Death_other", "Death_other"] <- 1
# m_tp_comp # show
```

### Transition matrix complete
The transition matrix should looks as follows:
```{r m_tp_1_show}
## Calculated parameters
p_post_major_stroke	<- 235 / 1000 # probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
p_post_minor_stroke	<- 1 - p_post_major_stroke # probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
r_inc_mi <- 400 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate MI
r_inc_stroke <- 50 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate stroke
r_mort <- 650 / 100000 # yearly rate of death

# Create transition matrix
m_tp_comp <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = n_hs,
                    nrow = n_hs,
                    dimnames = list(from = v_names_hs,
                                    to = v_names_hs)
                    )
# Fill in transition matrix
m_tp_comp["Well", "Well"] <- 1 - r_inc_mi - r_inc_stroke - r_mort 
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-minor_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_minor_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-major_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_major_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-MI"] <- r_inc_mi * (1 - r_fatal_mi)
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * r_fatal_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_MI"] <- r_inc_mi * r_fatal_mi
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Post-minor_stroke"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-major_stroke", "Post-major_stroke"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-major_stroke", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-MI", "Post-MI"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-MI", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Death_stroke", "Death_stroke"] <- 1
m_tp_comp["Death_MI", "Death_MI"] <- 1
m_tp_comp["Death_other", "Death_other"] <- 1
data.frame(round(m_tp_comp, 4)) # show
```

### Validation check  
Check whether the sum of all rows equals 1 to ensure you will not "add" or "loose" individuals in the simulation because the sum of probabilities do not sum up to 1 for each health states.  

```{r check_tp, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "m_tp_1-solution"}
# check the sum of all rows
```


```{r check_tp-hint}
"Use the rowSums() function"
```

```{r check_tp-solution}
rowSums(m_tp_comp) == 1
```

## Cohort simulation - "No aspirin"
It is now time to define and fill in the cohort simulation for the "No aspirin" strategy!  

### Fill in the transition matrix of the "No aspirin" strategy  
Assume all 100,000 individuals (`n_ind` object) start in the "Well" health state (first element of the `v_start_hs` vector), and perform the cohort simulation for the "No aspirin" strategy using the transition matrix `m_tp_comp`. Remember from previous assignment that you need the following elements to perform the cohort simulation:    
- `n_cycles`: the number of cycles to simulate, assume 10 years (yearly cycles)  
- `n_ind`: the number of individuals to simulate, assume 100,000  
- `v_start_hs`: a vector determining the starting position of the individuals over the different cycles (assume all individuals start in the "Well" health state)  
- `m_hs_comp`: a matrix to store the number of individuals in each health state during each cycle for the comparator. This matrix has `n_cycles` + 1 row (because we need to account for the start position), and as much columns as health states 75). Numerate the rows from 0 to `n_cycles` and name the column with the names of the health states ("Well", "Post-minor_stroke", "Post-major_stroke", "Post-MI", "Death_stroke", "Death_MI", "Death_other").  
`m_tp_comp`, `n_cycles`, and `n_ind` are already loaded. First, define `v_start_hs` and `m_hs_comp`. Second, use `v_start_hs` to determine the starting position of the individuals in the simulation, i.e. the first row of `m_hs_comp`. Finally, fill in `m_hs_comp` using matrix multiplication and the objects: `m_tp_comp` and `m_hs_comp`.  

```{r cohort_comp, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "inputs_complete_setup"}
# Define cohort simulation matrix

# Define the starting position of the individuals in each health state

# Perform the matrix multiplication (for loop) to fill in the cohort simulation
```

```{r cohort_comp-hint}
# Define cohort simulation matrix
m_hs_comp <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = '__',
                    nrow = '__',
                    dimnames = list(cycle = '__',
                                    health_state = '__'
                    )
)

# Define the starting position of the individuals in each health state
m_hs_comp[1, ] <- '__'

# Perform the matrix multiplication (for loop) to fill in the cohort simulation
for(cycle in 1:n_cycles){
  
  m_hs_comp[cycle + 1, ] <- '__' # perform matrix multiplication here
  
}
```

```{r cohort_comp-solution}
# Define cohort simulation matrix
m_hs_comp <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = n_hs,
                    nrow = n_cycles + 1,
                    dimnames = list(cycle = c(0:n_cycles),
                                    health_state = v_names_hs)
                    )

# Define the starting position of the individuals in each health state
m_hs_comp[1, ] <- v_start_hs

# Perform the matrix multiplication (for loop) to fill in the cohort simulation
for(cycle in 1:n_cycles){
  
  m_hs_comp[cycle + 1, ] <- m_hs_comp[cycle, ] %*% m_tp_comp # matrix multiplication
  
}
```

### Validation check  
Check whether all rows sum up to 100,000 to ensure you do not 'loose' or 'add' any person to the cohort simulation. Sometimes, due to rounding errors, it may seem that the sum does not exactly match the number of individuals, so round your sums to 5 decimals.  

```{r cohort_check, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "cohort_comp-solution"}


```

```{r cohort_check-solution}
round(rowSums(m_hs_comp), 5) == n_ind
```

## Improving transition matrix and cohort simulation
In this part of the assignmment, we will improve the transition matrix and cohort simulation of the "No aspirin" strategy that you just have built.  
We will now use age-dependent mortality values since we only used a mean estimate for all age in the previous assignment. However, the probability of death is increasing with age. Furthermore, you will include the "Aspirin" strategy to the model and make the comparison between the "Aspirin" and "No Aspirin" strategies.  
To do so, you will first define the cohort simulations of both strategies (using (age-dependent) transition probabilities, a three-dimentional array, and matrix multiplication) and then calculate the outcomes (quality-adjusted life years, costs). 
The method described in this practical is more extensively described in [Alarid Escudero et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07824). The approach we will use to do so is also similar to the one described in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4ZeRL-HeSs&list=PLIT7NqYN7YT3fUQhsAQ8Pn7-SHRpCy-U7&index=3).  

### Model inputs
Here below you can see the inputs we will use in the model.

```{r inputs_time_var_setup, echo = T}
#### 0. Define model parameters ----

# Setting parameters
n_cycles <- 10 # number of cycles
r_d_effects <- 0.015 # annual discount rate, health effects
r_d_costs <- 0.04 # annual discount rate, costs
v_names_hs <- c("Well", "Post-minor_stroke", "Post-major_stroke", "Post-MI", "Death_stroke", "Death_MI", "Death_other") # vector of names of health states
n_hs <- length(v_names_hs) # number of health states
n_ind <- 100000 # number of individuals to simulate  
v_start_hs <- c(n_ind, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) # vector of starting position in the model  

# Input parameters

## Rates & probabilities
r_fatal_mi	<- 0.25 # rate fatal MI
r_fatal_stroke	<- 0.3 # rate fatal stroke
r_inc_mi <- 400 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate MI
r_inc_stroke <- 50 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate stroke
r_mort <- 650 / 100000 # yearly rate of death

p_post_major_stroke	<- 235 / 1000 # probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
p_post_minor_stroke	<- 1 - p_post_major_stroke # probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured

## Treatment effectiveness
eff_mi	<- 0.6 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a MI
eff_stroke	<- 1.2 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a stroke

## Utility values 
u_healthy	<- 1 # utility value health state: Well
u_post_mi	<- 0.85 # utility value health state: Post-MI
u_post_minor_stroke	<- 0.75 # utility value health state: Post-minor stroke
u_post_major_stroke	<- 0.5 # utility value health state: Post-major stroke
u_aspirin_use	<- 0.999 # utility value health state: Well when using aspiring

## Costs
c_aspirin_use	<- 100 # yearly costs of using aspiring
c_post_mi	<- 8000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL MI
c_post_minor_stroke	<- 2000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL minor stroke
c_post_major_stroke	<- 20000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON_FATAL major stroke
```

### Age-dependent mortality data  
As you can see in the R chunk above, there are no transition probabilities defined for the yearly rate of death (from other causes), `r_mort`. This is because we will now make this probability of death dependent on the age of individuals in the health economic model.  
To do so, we need the rate of death for each age. For this assignment, these rates have been obtained from the central bureau of statistics and are displayed below per 10,000 individuals. These rates are stored in the `df_mort` dataframe displayed below. The `df_mort` dataframe contain two variables:  

- `Age` contains the age of Dutch individuals  
- `R_mort_10000` contains the mortality rate, per 10,000 individuals  

```{r mort_data}
df_mort
```

Using the `df_mort` dataframe, calculate the per-person mortality rate as a new column `R_mort` in the `df_mort` dataframe.  

```{r calc_mort_data, exercise = TRUE}
# calculate the per person mortality rate
```


```{r calc_mort_data-solution}
df_mort$R_mort <- df_mort$R_mort_10000 / 10000
#df_mort[, c("Age", "R_mort")] # show
```


### Filling in the "No aspirin" strategy transition array
Now that we have calculated the per person mortality rates for each age, we can include them in the transition array that we will use in the health economic model. To include these age-dependent transition probabilities in the model, we have to use 3-dimentional (3D) arrays instead of fixed transition matrices. The use of these 3D arrays allow to select a different transition matrix (containing different transition probabilities) for each cycle of the model. Arrays are defined using the `array()` function. The code chunk below shows how to define the transition array for the "No aspirin group. The comments describe what is happening. Have a look at the code and try to understand it! Below the code chunk, you can see the two first and two last transition matrix contained in the array. As you can see, the transition of to the `Death_other` health state has increased between the first and last cycles, as we expected!       
*NOTE: elements in a array are called by the number of dimension of the array. Thus, a single element of a 3D array is called via a x, y, and z dimension. If only the x and y coordinates are provided, the vector of elements with the coordinates x and y is returned. In this case, the third dimension (the 'z') represents the cycle number while the rows and columns represent the same as in the transition matrix (transition from - to).*  

```{r a_tp_1, echo = TRUE}
#### Define 3D array "No aspirin" group ----

# Define start age cohort
n_start_age <- 45

# Calculate per person mortality rate
df_mort$R_mort <- df_mort$R_mort_10000 / 10000

# Create a vector containing the mortality probability values for the age `n_start_age` to `n_start_age`+9
v_p_mort <- df_mort[c(which(df_mort$Age == n_start_age):
                        which(df_mort$Age == n_start_age + (n_cycles - 1)
                              )
                      ), "R_mort"]

# Initialise 3D array which will contain the transition probabilities
a_tp_comp <- array(0, dim = c(n_hs, n_hs, n_cycles),
                               dimnames = list(v_names_hs, v_names_hs, 1:n_cycles)
                               )

# Fill in the arrays using the background mortality for each age 
a_tp_comp["Well", "Well", ]   <- 1 - v_p_mort - r_inc_mi - r_inc_stroke  
##!!Notice, that only using the first 2 elements of the array will fill these transition probabilities for all 10 transition matrices used in all cycles!!

a_tp_comp["Well", "Post-minor_stroke", ] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_minor_stroke
a_tp_comp["Well", "Post-major_stroke", ] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_major_stroke
a_tp_comp["Well", "Post-MI", ] <- r_inc_mi * (1 - r_fatal_mi)
a_tp_comp["Well", "Death_stroke", ] <- r_inc_stroke * r_fatal_stroke
a_tp_comp["Well", "Death_MI", ] <- r_inc_mi * r_fatal_mi
a_tp_comp["Well", "Death_other", ] <- v_p_mort

a_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Post-minor_stroke", ] <- 1 - v_p_mort
a_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Death_other", ] <- v_p_mort

a_tp_comp["Post-major_stroke", "Post-major_stroke", ] <- 1 - v_p_mort
a_tp_comp["Post-major_stroke", "Death_other", ] <- v_p_mort

a_tp_comp["Post-MI", "Post-MI", ] <- 1 - v_p_mort
a_tp_comp["Post-MI", "Death_other", ] <- v_p_mort

a_tp_comp["Death_stroke", "Death_stroke",] <- 1
a_tp_comp["Death_MI", "Death_MI",] <- 1
a_tp_comp["Death_other", "Death_other",] <- 1

a_tp_comp[, , c(1, 2, 9, 10)]
```

### Filling in the "Aspirin" strategy transition array  
It is now time to define and fill in the transition array for the "Aspirin" strategy, the intervention which will be compared to the "No aspirin" strategy.  
To do so, we have to perform the following:  
1. Make a copy of `a_tp_comp` and call it `a_tp_int`. This will be the transition array we will use for the "Aspirin" strategy.  
2. Aspirin has an effect on the probability of experiencing an MI (object `eff_mi`) and stroke (object `eff_stroke`). Use these two input parameters to adjust the probabilities to experience these cardiovascular events in the `a_tp_int` array. Again you may use the rates as probabilities when calculating the transitions. Assume that once individuals had an event they will no longer use aspirin.  

```{r a_tp_2, exercise = TRUE}
# Make a copy of `a_tp_comp` and call it `a_tp_int`

# Modify the transition probabilities in `a_tp_int` since Aspirin has an effect on the occurence of MI and stroke

```

```{r a_tp_2-hint}
# Make a copy of `a_tp_comp` and call it `a_tp_int`
a_tp_int <- a_tp_comp

# Modify the transition probabilities in `a_tp_int` since Aspirin has an effect on the occurence of MI and stroke
## Multiply `r_inc_stroke` and `r_inc_mi` by  `eff_stroke` and `eff_mi` respectively to apply the effectiveness of Aspirin on the occurence of stroke and MI
## Do not forget to also modify the probability of staying in the "WELL" health state since less individuals will experience cardiovascular events!
```

```{r a_tp_2-solution}
# Make a copy of `a_tp_comp` and call it `a_tp_int`
a_tp_int <- a_tp_comp

# Modify the transition probabilities in `a_tp_int` since Aspirin has an effect on the occurence of MI and stroke
a_tp_int["Well", "Well", ]   <- 1 - v_p_mort - r_inc_mi * eff_mi - r_inc_stroke * eff_stroke
a_tp_int["Well", "Post-minor_stroke", ] <- r_inc_stroke * eff_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_minor_stroke
a_tp_int["Well", "Post-major_stroke", ] <- r_inc_stroke * eff_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_major_stroke
a_tp_int["Well", "Post-MI", ] <- r_inc_mi * eff_mi * (1 - r_fatal_mi)
a_tp_int["Well", "Death_stroke", ] <- r_inc_stroke * eff_stroke * r_fatal_stroke
a_tp_int["Well", "Death_MI", ] <- r_inc_mi * eff_mi * r_fatal_mi

#a_tp_int[,, 1] # show first transition matrix of the array
```

### Performing the cohort simulation
Since we now have transition matrices for both strategies, we can perform the cohort simulation for both strategies. As a reminder, the steps to perform the cohort simulations are the following:  
- Define the matrix in which the cohort simulation will be stored (`m_hs_comp` and `m_hs_int`)  
- Determine the starting position of the cohort in the matrix of the cohort simulation, using `v_hs_start` (already defined)  
- Perform the simulation by using matrix multiplication of the cohort simulation and the transition array. In this case, we have to loop over the cycles (rows) of the cohort simulation but also over the matrices of the `a_tp_comp` and `a_tp_int` arrays.  

The R code chunk below shows how to do this for the "No aspirin" strategy.  

```{r time_dep_cohort_show}
#### Fill the cohort simulation for the "No aspirin" strategy ----

# Create a matrix to store the cohort simulation (`m_hs_comp`)
m_hs_comp <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = length(v_names_hs),
                    nrow = n_cycles + 1,
                    dimnames = list(c(0:n_cycles),
                                    v_names_hs)
                    ) 

# Define the start position of individuals (all in "well")
m_hs_comp[1,] <- v_start_hs

# Perform the matrix multiplication using the 3D array.
for(cycle in 1:n_cycles){
  m_hs_comp[cycle + 1,] <- m_hs_comp[cycle,] %*% a_tp_comp[, , cycle]
}
```

Perform the matrix multiplication for the "Aspirin" strategy using the same method.  

```{r time_dep_cohort_int, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "a_tp_2-solution"}
#### Fill the cohort simulation for the "Aspirin" strategy ----

# Create a matrix to store the cohort simulation (`m_hs_int`)

# Define the start position of individuals (all in "well")

# Perform the matrix multiplication using the 3D array.

```

```{r time_dep_cohort_int-solution}
#### Fill the cohort simulation for the "Aspirin" strategy ----

# Create a matrix to store the cohort simulation (`m_hs_int`)
m_hs_int <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = length(v_names_hs),
                    nrow = n_cycles + 1,
                    dimnames = list(c(0:n_cycles),
                                    v_names_hs)
) 

# Define the start position of individuals (all in "well")
m_hs_int[1,] <- v_start_hs

# Perform the matrix multiplication using the 3D array.
for(cycle in 1:n_cycles){
  m_hs_int[cycle + 1,] <- m_hs_int[cycle,] %*% a_tp_int[, , cycle]
}
```

### Results

# Modify the transition probabilities in `a_tp_int` since Aspirin has an effect on the occurence of MI and stroke
a_tp_int["Well", "Well", ]   <- 1 - v_p_mort - r_inc_mi * eff_mi - r_inc_stroke * eff_stroke
a_tp_int["Well", "Post-minor_stroke", ] <- r_inc_stroke * eff_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_minor_stroke

) 

# Define the start position of individuals (all in "well")

# Perform the matrix multiplication using the 3D array.

  m_hs_int[cycle + 1,] <- m_hs_int[cycle,] %*% a_tp_int[, , cycle]
}
data.frame(round(m_hs_int))
```

data.frame(round(m_hs_comp))
```

## Calculating undiscounted outcomes
Now that we know the life course of the hypothetical individuals in both strategies, we can calculate the (un)discounted costs and effects (LYs and QALYs) over time. For convenience, account for state membership at the end of the year. Not all 100,000 individuals are considered to be "Well" at the start of year 1. You do not have to apply half-cycle correction. Practically, this means that you do not account for the state membership at cycle 0, the starting position.  

### Life years
Calculate the life years of both strategies and the cumulative life years over the 10 years of the model. This is done in two steps:  
1.Define two vectors (`v_ly_comp` & `v_ly_int`) of 7 values which determine the number of life  years gained by an individual in each health state during a single cycle. These vectors are called the **rewards** vectors. The rewards vector should be ordered as the health states in the `m_hs_comp` & `m_hs_int` cohort simulation. For health state where individuals are alive, the reward should be 1, and 0 for the "Death" health states.  
2. Use matrix multiplication to multiply these health state rewards by the membership of individuals over the cycles (from row 2 onwards!). Store these results in vectors called `v_t_ly_comp` & `v_t_ly_int`, calculate the cumulative number of life years over the cycles (`v_cum_ly_comp` & `v_cum_ly_int`, using the `cumsum()` function) and calculate the total number of life years for each strategy as the sum of these vectors (`n_t_ly_comp` & `n_t_ly_int`).  
The calculations for the LYs are provided in the R code chunk below.  

```{r calc_ly_show, echo = T}
#### Calculate for undiscounted outcomes ---

## Life years
## Determine the number of life years won by 1 individual during 1 cycle in both strategies
v_ly_comp <- c("Well" = 1,
               "Post-minor_stroke" = 1, 
               "Post-major_stroke" = 1, 
               "Post-MI" = 1, 
               "Death_stroke" = 0, 
               "Death_MI" = 0, 
               "Death_other" = 0)
v_ly_int <- c("Well" = 1,
               "Post-minor_stroke" = 1, 
               "Post-major_stroke" = 1, 
               "Post-MI" = 1, 
               "Death_stroke" = 0, 
               "Death_MI" = 0, 
               "Death_other" = 0)

## Determine the number of life year gained over the cycles (reward at the end of the cycle!)
v_t_ly_comp <- m_hs_comp[2:nrow(m_hs_comp),] %*% v_ly_comp
v_t_ly_int  <- m_hs_int[2:nrow(m_hs_int),] %*% v_ly_int

## Determine the cumulative number of life year gained over the cycles (reward at the end of the cycle!)
v_cum_ly_comp <- cumsum(v_t_ly_comp)
v_cum_ly_int  <- cumsum(v_t_ly_int)

## Determine the total number of life year gained (sum of all cycles; reward at the end of the cycle!)
n_t_ly_comp <- sum(v_t_ly_comp)
n_t_ly_int <- sum(v_t_ly_int)
```

### QALYs
Using the utility values per health state defined below, calculate the total quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) in each year for the 100,000 hypothetical individuals in each group. Use the same approach as for the life years calculations, except that the state rewards are different and may differ across strategies. Calculate also the cumulative and total QALY gained.  
**Assumptions:** Individuals in the "Well" health state have a utility value equal to`u_healthy` in the "No Aspirin" group, while in the "Aspirin" group, they have the utility associated with use of aspirin, `u_aspiring_use`. Individuals in the "Death" health states do not accrue QALYs. 

```{r show_utils, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Utility values 
u_healthy	<- 1 # utility value health state: Well
u_post_mi	<- 0.85 # utility value health state: Post-MI
u_post_minor_stroke	<- 0.75 # utility value health state: Post-minor stroke
u_post_major_stroke	<- 0.5 # utility value health state: Post-major stroke

Using the annual costs per health state defined below, calculate the total costs in each year for the 100,000 hypothetical individuals. Use the same approach as for the life years calculation, except that the state rewards are different and may differ across strategies. Calculate also the cumulative and total costs.  
**Assumptions:** Individuals in the "Well" health state do not incur any costs in the "No aspirin" group. However, in the "Apsirin" group, individuals in the "Well" health state incur the costs associated with aspirin use. Assume that after a MI or stroke, individuals stop with aspirin. Individuals in the "Death" health states do not incur any costs.   

```{r show_costs, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Costs
c_aspirin_use	<- 100 # yearly costs of using aspiring
c_post_mi	<- 8000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL MI
c_post_minor_stroke	<- 2000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL minor stroke
c_post_major_stroke	<- 20000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON_FATAL major stroke
```

```

### Mean outcomes and comparison
Using the total undiscounted total outcomes, calculate the mean outcomes (life years, QALYs, costs) per individual for each strategy. Calculate the incremental QALYs and costs of the "Aspirin" versus "No aspirin" group and calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

## Calculating discounted outcomes  
Since individuals attach more value to outcomes happening in the present than in the future, we have to discount the outcomes (LY, QALY, costs) taking place in the future. For a refresher on discounting, see the previous practical and pre-recorded videos.  
We will now focus on calculating the discounted results. We will use the suffix `_d` to indicate that the objects contain discounted results.  

### Life years
To calculate discounted results, the following steps should be performed:
1. Define a vector of length `n_cycles`, which contain the discount weights for each cycle. Name the discount weights vector for health effects `v_dw_e` and for costs `v_dw_c`. The yearly discount rates for health effects and costs are provided under the objects `r_d_effects` and `r_d_costs`. The discount rates are set to 1.5% (0.015) for health effects and 4% (0.04) for costs according to the Dutch guideline for economic evaluation in health care.  
2. Use matrix multiplication of the vector of total outcomes (LY, QALYs, or costs) defined in the previous step by the vector of discount weights.  
The calculations are performed for discounted life years in the following R code chunk.  

```{r calc_ly_d_show, echo = T}
#### Calculate discounted results ----

# Life years
## Define discount weights per cycle (years in this case)
v_dw_e <- 1 / (1 + r_d_effects) ^ c(1:n_cycles)

## Total discounted life years, using matrix multiplication
n_t_ly_comp_d <- t(v_t_ly_comp) %*% v_dw_e
n_t_ly_int_d  <- t(v_t_ly_int) %*% v_dw_e

## Mean discounted LY per strategy
ly_comp_d <- n_t_ly_comp_d / n_ind
ly_int_d <- n_t_ly_int_d / n_ind
```

### QALYS, costs, and mean outcomes  
Use the example above to calculate the total discounted QALYs and costs. Then, calculate the mean discounted QALYs and costs per individual for each strategy. Finally, calculate the incremental QALYs and costs of the "Aspirin" versus "No aspirin" group and calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, using these discounted results.

# Costs
## Define discount weights per cycle (years in this case)

n_t_c_comp_d <- t(v_t_c_comp) %*% v_dw_c
n_t_c_int_d  <- t(v_t_c_int) %*% v_dw_c

# Calculate mean discounted QALYs and costs per individual
qaly_comp_d <- n_t_qaly_comp_d / n_ind
qaly_int_d <- n_t_qaly_int_d / n_ind

c_comp_d <- n_t_c_comp_d / n_ind
c_int_d <- n_t_c_int_d / n_ind

# Calculate incrementals and ICER
inc_qaly_d <- qaly_int_d - qaly_comp_d
inc_c_d <- c_int_d - c_comp_d

ICER_d <- inc_c_d / inc_qaly_d
