## Before starting
1. Watch the videos explaining how a Health State Transition Model (HSTM) works and can be used for a cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA), and on uncertainty assessment. To do so, you probably need to open open the tutorial in your browser using the 'Open in Browser' button on the upper left side of the screen.

## Aim and instructions
The aim of this practical assignment is to get you acquainted with the principle of HSTM. This assignmment focuses on evaluating the cost-effectiveness of aspirin treatment versus no aspirin treatment for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events using a HSTM, also called Markov model. During this assignment, you will first define the cohort simulation of both strategies (using transition probabilities, and matrix multiplication) and then calculate the outcomes (quality-adjusted life years, costs). First, familiarise yourself with the model structure.  
The method described in this practical is more extensively described in [Alarid Escudero et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07824).  

```{r, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "70%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("Tutorial_hstm_2_files/images/Image_hint.png")
```

```{r, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "70%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("Tutorial_hstm_2_files/images/Image_solution.png")
```

### Prerequisites
You should be able to use the following commands to perform this exercise:  

- `which()` function  
- `matrix()` and `array()` functions  
- `rowSums()` function
- perform matrix multiplication using `%*%`  
- using the command `for()` to perform forward loop  

## Model structure & parameters  
**DISCLAIMER: FOR THE FOLLOWING ASSIGNMENT, ASSUME THAT PROBABILITIES ARE THE SAME AS RATES. SEE *[Fleurence & Hollenbeak 2007]*(https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200725010-00002) FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RATES AND PROBABILITIES AND REMEMBER THAT WE USUALLY USE PROBABILITIES IN HEALTH ECONOMIC MODELLING** 

### Model structure
In this HSTM, individuals either receive aspirin or not (the two strategies we compare).In this model, individuals may remain "Well", or they can experience a stroke or a myocardial infarction (MI). These two events may be fatal or individuals may remain alive in the "Post-minor stroke", "Post-major stroke", or "Post-MI" health states when they survive these events. From all health states, individuals may die from general causes of death to "Death other".  
  
```{r, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "90%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("Tutorial_hstm_2_files/images/Fig_model_structure.png")
```

### Model inputs
As you can see both strategies (prescribing aspirin or not) have similar diagrams. However, there will be differences in the values of the parameters applied in these strategies. First, we will focus on the disease progression of patients not using aspirin. Have a look at the input parameters which are already defined herebelow.   

```{r inputs_gen, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Setting parameters
n_cycles <- 10 # number of cycles in the health economic model
r_d_effects <- 0.015 # annual discount rate, health effects
r_d_costs <- 0.04 # annual discount rate, costs
v_names_hs <- c("Well", "Post-minor_stroke", "Post-major_stroke", "Post-MI", "Death_stroke", "Death_MI", "Death_other") # vector of names of health states
n_hs <- length(v_names_hs) # number of health states
n_ind <- 100000 # number of individuals to simulate  
v_start_hs <- c(n_ind, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) # vector of starting position in the model  

# Input parameters

## Rates & probabilities
r_fatal_mi	<- 0.25 # rate fatal MI - no-Aspirin strategy
r_fatal_stroke	<- 0.3 # rate fatal stroke - no-Aspirin strategy

## Treatment effectiveness
eff_mi	<- 0.6 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a MI
eff_stroke	<- 1.2 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a stroke

## Utility values 
u_healthy	<- 1 # utility value health state: Well
u_post_mi	<- 0.85 # utility value health state: Post-MI
u_post_minor_stroke	<- 0.75 # utility value health state: Post-minor stroke
u_post_major_stroke	<- 0.5 # utility value health state: Post-major stroke
u_aspirin_use	<- 0.999 # utility value health state: Well when using aspiring

## Costs
c_aspirin_use	<- 100 # yearly costs of using aspirin
c_post_mi	<- 8000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL MI
c_post_minor_stroke	<- 2000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL minor stroke
c_post_major_stroke	<- 20000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON_FATAL major stroke
```


When developing a health economic model we often have to combine evidence from different sources of literature. Assume that there was evidence that 235 out of 1,000 patients **who had a stroke and survived** moved into a post major stroke state (the remaining patients experienced a minor stroke). Based on this evidence, please define the parameter `p_minor_stroke` (probability of transiting to the "post-minor stroke" health state **after having experienced a NON-FATAL stroke** and `p_major_stroke` (probability of transiting to the "post-major stroke" health state **after having experienced a NON-FATAL stroke**.   
1.b. From other sources, you found that the incidence rates for myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and death from other causes were respectively **400, 50, and 650 per 100,000 person-years**. Calculate the yearly incidence rates of MI, stroke, and death from other causes than MI and stroke in the placeholder of parameters `r_inc_mi`, `r_inc_stroke`, and `r_mort`.  

```{r calc_inputs, exercise = TRUE}
# Parameters to calculate
# probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
# probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
# yearly incidence rate MI
# yearly incidence rate stroke
# yearly rate of death
```

```{r calc_inputs-hint}
# Example
p_post_major_stroke	<- 235 / 1000 # probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
p_post_minor_stroke	<- 1 - p_post_major_stroke # probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
```

```{r calc_inputs-solution}
p_post_major_stroke	<- 235 / 1000 # probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
p_post_minor_stroke	<- 1 - p_post_major_stroke # probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
r_inc_mi <- 400 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate MI
r_inc_stroke <- 50 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate stroke
r_mort <- 650 / 100000 # yearly rate of death
#data.frame(c(p_post_major_stroke, p_post_minor_stroke, r_inc_mi, r_inc_stroke, r_mort)) # show
```

## Transition matrices - "No aspirin" 

### Define the transition matrix of the "No aspirin" strategy  
The input parameter values looks as follows now. Based on these parameter values, determine the transition matrix of the "No aspirin" strategy, and call it `m_tp_comp` (for matrix transition probabilities of the comparator). Assume here that `r_mort` can be used for the probability of ‘Death other’.  

```{r inputs_complete_setup, echo = TRUE}
# Setting parameters
n_cycles <- 10 # number of cycles
r_d_effects <- 0.015 # annual discount rate, health effects
r_d_costs <- 0.04 # annual discount rate, costs
v_names_hs <- c("Well", "Post-minor_stroke", "Post-major_stroke", "Post-MI", "Death_stroke", "Death_MI", "Death_other") # vector of names of health states
n_hs <- length(v_names_hs) # number of health states
n_ind <- 100000 # number of individuals to simulate  
v_start_hs <- c(n_ind, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) # vector of starting position in the model  

# Input parameters

## Rates & probabilities
r_fatal_mi	<- 0.25 # rate fatal MI
r_fatal_stroke	<- 0.3 # rate fatal stroke

## Treatment effectiveness
eff_mi	<- 0.6 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a MI
eff_stroke	<- 1.2 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a stroke

## Utility values 
u_healthy	<- 1 # utility value health state: Well
u_post_mi	<- 0.85 # utility value health state: Post-MI
u_post_minor_stroke	<- 0.75 # utility value health state: Post-minor stroke
u_post_major_stroke	<- 0.5 # utility value health state: Post-major stroke
u_aspirin_use	<- 0.999 # utility value health state: Well when using aspiring

## Costs
c_aspirin_use	<- 100 # yearly costs of using aspiring
c_post_mi	<- 8000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL MI
c_post_minor_stroke	<- 2000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL minor stroke
c_post_major_stroke	<- 20000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON_FATAL major stroke

## Calculated parameters
p_post_major_stroke	<- 235 / 1000 # probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
p_post_minor_stroke	<- 1 - p_post_major_stroke # probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
r_inc_mi <- 400 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate MI
r_inc_stroke <- 50 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate stroke
r_mort <- 650 / 100000 # yearly rate of death
```

```{r m_tp_1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "inputs_complete_setup"}


```

```{r m_tp_1-hint-1}
"To do so, create a matrix of 7 by 7, and use the evidence `p_` and `r_` parameters to fill it in. Use the model structure to fill in the transition matrix. Once an individuals die, that person remains in that health state. The transition probabilities to the post-minor stroke health states are the product of experiencing a non-fatal stroke and of the consequences being minor or major."
```

```{r m_tp_1-hint-2}
# Create transition matrix
m_tp_comp <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = n_hs,
                    nrow = n_hs,
                    dimnames = list(from = v_names_hs,
                                    to = v_names_hs)
                    )
# Fill in transition matrix
m_tp_comp["Well", "Well"] <- 1 - r_inc_mi - r_inc_stroke - r_mort # example
```

```{r m_tp_1-solution}
# Create transition matrix
m_tp_comp <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = n_hs,
                    nrow = n_hs,
                    dimnames = list(from = v_names_hs,
                                    to = v_names_hs)
                    )
# Fill in transition matrix
m_tp_comp["Well", "Well"] <- 1 - r_inc_mi - r_inc_stroke - r_mort 
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-minor_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_minor_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-major_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_major_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-MI"] <- r_inc_mi * (1 - r_fatal_mi)
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * r_fatal_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_MI"] <- r_inc_mi * r_fatal_mi
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Post-minor_stroke"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-major_stroke", "Post-major_stroke"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-major_stroke", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-MI", "Post-MI"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-MI", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Death_stroke", "Death_stroke"] <- 1
m_tp_comp["Death_MI", "Death_MI"] <- 1
m_tp_comp["Death_other", "Death_other"] <- 1
# m_tp_comp # show
```

### Transition matrix complete
The transition matrix should looks as follows:
```{r m_tp_1_show}
## Calculated parameters
p_post_major_stroke	<- 235 / 1000 # probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
p_post_minor_stroke	<- 1 - p_post_major_stroke # probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
r_inc_mi <- 400 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate MI
r_inc_stroke <- 50 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate stroke
r_mort <- 650 / 100000 # yearly rate of death

# Create transition matrix
m_tp_comp <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = n_hs,
                    nrow = n_hs,
                    dimnames = list(from = v_names_hs,
                                    to = v_names_hs)
                    )
# Fill in transition matrix
m_tp_comp["Well", "Well"] <- 1 - r_inc_mi - r_inc_stroke - r_mort 
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-minor_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_minor_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-major_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_major_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Post-MI"] <- r_inc_mi * (1 - r_fatal_mi)
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_stroke"] <- r_inc_stroke * r_fatal_stroke
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_MI"] <- r_inc_mi * r_fatal_mi
m_tp_comp["Well", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Post-minor_stroke"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-major_stroke", "Post-major_stroke"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-major_stroke", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Post-MI", "Post-MI"] <- 1 - r_mort
m_tp_comp["Post-MI", "Death_other"] <- r_mort

m_tp_comp["Death_stroke", "Death_stroke"] <- 1
m_tp_comp["Death_MI", "Death_MI"] <- 1
m_tp_comp["Death_other", "Death_other"] <- 1
data.frame(round(m_tp_comp, 4)) # show
```

### Validation check  
Check whether the sum of all rows equals 1 to ensure you will not "add" or "loose" individuals in the simulation because the sum of probabilities do not sum up to 1 for each health states.  

```{r check_tp, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "m_tp_1-solution"}
# check the sum of all rows
```


```{r check_tp-hint}
"Use the rowSums() function"
```

```{r check_tp-solution}
rowSums(m_tp_comp) == 1
```

## Cohort simulation - "No aspirin"
It is now time to define and fill in the cohort simulation for the "No aspirin" strategy!  

### Fill in the transition matrix of the "No aspirin" strategy  
Assume all 100,000 individuals (`n_ind` object) start in the "Well" health state (first element of the `v_start_hs` vector), and perform the cohort simulation for the "No aspirin" strategy using the transition matrix `m_tp_comp`. Remember from previous assignment that you need the following elements to perform the cohort simulation:    
- `n_cycles`: the number of cycles to simulate, assume 10 years (yearly cycles)  
- `n_ind`: the number of individuals to simulate, assume 100,000  
- `v_start_hs`: a vector determining the starting position of the individuals over the different cycles (assume all individuals start in the "Well" health state)  
- `m_hs_comp`: a matrix to store the number of individuals in each health state during each cycle for the comparator. This matrix has `n_cycles` + 1 row (because we need to account for the start position), and as much columns as health states 75). Numerate the rows from 0 to `n_cycles` and name the column with the names of the health states ("Well", "Post-minor_stroke", "Post-major_stroke", "Post-MI", "Death_stroke", "Death_MI", "Death_other").  
`m_tp_comp`, `n_cycles`, and `n_ind` are already loaded. First, define `v_start_hs` and `m_hs_comp`. Second, use `v_start_hs` to determine the starting position of the individuals in the simulation, i.e. the first row of `m_hs_comp`. Finally, fill in `m_hs_comp` using matrix multiplication and the objects: `m_tp_comp` and `m_hs_comp`.  

```{r cohort_comp, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "inputs_complete_setup"}
# Define cohort simulation matrix

# Define the starting position of the individuals in each health state

# Perform the matrix multiplication (for loop) to fill in the cohort simulation
```

```{r cohort_comp-hint}
# Define cohort simulation matrix
m_hs_comp <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = '__',
                    nrow = '__',
                    dimnames = list(cycle = '__',
                                    health_state = '__'
                    )
)

# Define the starting position of the individuals in each health state
m_hs_comp[1, ] <- '__'

# Perform the matrix multiplication (for loop) to fill in the cohort simulation
for(cycle in 1:n_cycles){
  
  m_hs_comp[cycle + 1, ] <- '__' # perform matrix multiplication here
  
}
```

```{r cohort_comp-solution}
# Define cohort simulation matrix
m_hs_comp <- matrix(0,
                    ncol = n_hs,
                    nrow = n_cycles + 1,
                    dimnames = list(cycle = c(0:n_cycles),
                                    health_state = v_names_hs)
                    )

# Define the starting position of the individuals in each health state
m_hs_comp[1, ] <- v_start_hs

# Perform the matrix multiplication (for loop) to fill in the cohort simulation
for(cycle in 1:n_cycles){
  
  m_hs_comp[cycle + 1, ] <- m_hs_comp[cycle, ] %*% m_tp_comp # matrix multiplication
  
}
```

### Validation check  
Check whether all rows sum up to 100,000 to ensure you do not 'loose' or 'add' any person to the cohort simulation. Sometimes, due to rounding errors, it may seem that the sum does not exactly match the number of individuals, so round your sums to 5 decimals.  

```{r cohort_check, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "cohort_comp-solution"}


```

```{r cohort_check-solution}
round(rowSums(m_hs_comp), 5) == n_ind
```

## Improving transition matrix and cohort simulation
In this part of the assignmment, we will improve the transition matrix and cohort simulation of the "No aspirin" strategy that you just have built.  
We will now use age-dependent mortality values since we only used a mean estimate for all age in the previous assignment. However, the probability of death is increasing with age. Furthermore, you will include the "Aspirin" strategy to the model and make the comparison between the "Aspirin" and "No Aspirin" strategies.  
To do so, you will first define the cohort simulations of both strategies (using (age-dependent) transition probabilities, a three-dimentional array, and matrix multiplication) and then calculate the outcomes (quality-adjusted life years, costs). 
The method described in this practical is more extensively described in [Alarid Escudero et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07824). The approach we will use to do so is also similar to the one described in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4ZeRL-HeSs&list=PLIT7NqYN7YT3fUQhsAQ8Pn7-SHRpCy-U7&index=3).  

### Transition array "No Aspirin" strategy
Here below you can see the inputs we will use in the model.

```{r inputs_time_var_setup, echo = T}
#### 0. Define model parameters ----

# Setting parameters
n_cycles <- 10 # number of cycles
r_d_effects <- 0.015 # annual discount rate, health effects
r_d_costs <- 0.04 # annual discount rate, costs
v_names_hs <- c("Well", "Post-minor_stroke", "Post-major_stroke", "Post-MI", "Death_stroke", "Death_MI", "Death_other") # vector of names of health states
n_hs <- length(v_names_hs) # number of health states
n_ind <- 100000 # number of individuals to simulate  
v_start_hs <- c(n_ind, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) # vector of starting position in the model  

# Input parameters

## Rates & probabilities
r_fatal_mi	<- 0.25 # rate fatal MI
r_fatal_stroke	<- 0.3 # rate fatal stroke
r_inc_mi <- 400 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate MI
r_inc_stroke <- 50 / 100000 # yearly incidence rate stroke
r_mort <- 650 / 100000 # yearly rate of death

p_post_major_stroke	<- 235 / 1000 # probability to transit to "Post-major stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured
p_post_minor_stroke	<- 1 - p_post_major_stroke # probability to transit to "Post-minor stroke" after a NON-FATAL stroke occured

## Treatment effectiveness
eff_mi	<- 0.6 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a MI
eff_stroke	<- 1.2 # Treatment effectiveness of Aspirin on the probability of experiencing a stroke

## Utility values 
u_healthy	<- 1 # utility value health state: Well
u_post_mi	<- 0.85 # utility value health state: Post-MI
u_post_minor_stroke	<- 0.75 # utility value health state: Post-minor stroke
u_post_major_stroke	<- 0.5 # utility value health state: Post-major stroke
u_aspirin_use	<- 0.999 # utility value health state: Well when using aspiring

## Costs
c_aspirin_use	<- 100 # yearly costs of using aspiring
c_post_mi	<- 8000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL MI
c_post_minor_stroke	<- 2000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON-FATAL minor stroke
c_post_major_stroke	<- 20000 # yearly costs after having experienced a NON_FATAL major stroke
```

As you can see in the R chunk above, there are no transition probabilities defined for the yearly rate of death (from other causes), `r_mort`. This is because we will now make this probability of death dependent on the age of individuals in the health economic model.  
To do so, we need the rate of death for each age. For this assignment, these rates have been obtained from the central bureau of statistics and are displayed below per 10,000 individuals. These rates are stored in the `df_mort` dataframe displayed below. The `df_mort` dataframe contain two variables:  

- `Age` contains the age of Dutch individuals  
- `R_mort_10000` contains the mortality rate, per 10,000 individuals  

```{r mort_data}
df_mort
```

Using the `df_mort` dataframe, calculate the per-person mortality rate as a new column `R_mort` in the `df_mort` dataframe.  

```{r calc_mort_data, exercise = TRUE}
# calculate the per person mortality rate
```


```{r calc_mort_data-solution}
df_mort$R_mort <- df_mort$R_mort_10000 / 10000
```

Now that we have calculated the per person mortality rates for each age, we can include them in the transition array that we will use in the health economic model. To include these age-dependent transition probabilities in the model, we have to use 3-dimentional (3D) arrays instead of fixed transition matrices. The use of these 3D arrays allow to select a different transition matrix (containing different transition probabilities) for each cycle of the model. Arrays are defined using the `array()` function. The code chunk below shows how to define the transition array for the "No aspirin group. The comments describe what is happening. Have a look at the code and try to understand it! Below the code chunk, you can see the two first and two last transition matrix contained in the array. As you can see, the transition of to the `Death_other` health state has increased between the first and last cycles, as we expected!       

```{r a_tp_1, echo = TRUE}
#### 1. Define 3D array "No aspirin" group ----

# Define start age cohort
n_start_age <- 45

# Calculate per person mortality rate
df_mort$R_mort <- df_mort$R_mort_10000 / 10000

# Create a vector containing the mortality probability values for the age `n_start_age` to `n_start_age`+9
v_p_mort <- df_mort[c(which(df_mort$Age == n_start_age):
                        which(df_mort$Age == n_start_age + (n_cycles - 1)
                              )
                      ), "R_mort"]

# Initialise 3D array which will contain the transition probabilities
a_tp_comp <- array(0, dim = c(n_hs, n_hs, n_cycles),
                               dimnames = list(v_names_hs, v_names_hs, 1:n_cycles)
                               )

# Fill in the arrays using the background mortality for each age 
a_tp_comp["Well", "Well", ]   <- 1 - v_p_mort - r_inc_mi - r_inc_stroke  
##!!Notice, that only using the first 2 elements of the array will fill these transition probabilities for all 10 transition matrices used in all cycles!!

a_tp_comp["Well", "Post-minor_stroke", ] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_minor_stroke
a_tp_comp["Well", "Post-major_stroke", ] <- r_inc_stroke * (1 - r_fatal_stroke) * p_post_major_stroke
a_tp_comp["Well", "Post-MI", ] <- r_inc_mi * (1 - r_fatal_mi)
a_tp_comp["Well", "Death_stroke", ] <- r_inc_stroke * r_fatal_stroke
a_tp_comp["Well", "Death_MI", ] <- r_inc_mi * r_fatal_mi
a_tp_comp["Well", "Death_other", ] <- v_p_mort

a_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Post-minor_stroke", ] <- 1 - v_p_mort
a_tp_comp["Post-minor_stroke", "Death_other", ] <- v_p_mort

a_tp_comp["Post-major_stroke", "Post-major_stroke", ] <- 1 - v_p_mort

a_tp_comp["Post-MI", "Death_other", ] <- v_p_mort

a_tp_comp["Death_stroke", "Death_stroke",] <- 1
a_tp_comp["Death_MI", "Death_MI",] <- 1
a_tp_comp["Death_other", "Death_other",] <- 1

a_tp_comp[, , c(1, 2, 9, 10)]
```
