## Discounting

### Aims and instructions
This assignment aims to introduce you to the concept of discounting in health economic evaluations, using a fictive example containing 3 interventions.  
**OF NOTE**: the solutions which are provided are one way to perform the calculations, you can obtain the same results using other fomula's. The last 'Hint' is always the solution of the assignment. Solutions can be copy/paste in the chunk as shown in the figures below. Once you have completed a code chunk, you can run it by pushing the 'Run code' button on the upper-right side of the chunk.    

```{r, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "70%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("Tutorial_discounting_files/images/Image_hint.png")
```

```{r, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "70%", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("Tutorial_discounting_files/images/Image_solution.png")
```

## The data
The assignment uses the `df_thx` object, which is already loaded in this tutorial. 

The `df_thx` object contains 7 variables:  

- Year = the year in which incremental costs and effects have been incurred (from Year 0 to 12) 
- Inc_cost_A = INCREMENTAL costs (in euros) of intervention A in the different years  
- Inc_QALY_A = INCREMENTAL effects (QALYs) of intervention A in the different years  
- Inc_cost_B = INCREMENTAL costs (in euros) of intervention B in the different years  
- Inc_QALY_B = INCREMENTAL effects (QALYs) of intervention B in the different years  
- Inc_cost_C = INCREMENTAL costs (in euros) of intervention C in the different years  
- Inc_QALY_C = INCREMENTAL effects (QALYs) of intervention C in the different years  

**Assume that all incremental costs and QALYs of these interventions are calculated against usual care.**

The `df_thx` object is displayed here below. Have a look at this data.frame before starting the assignment.
```{r show_data}
df_thx
```

## Undiscounted results

### Total undiscounted costs and effects
Before discounting the effects and costs, calculate the total **undiscounted** incremental costs and effects of each intervention.  

```{r calc_res_undisc, exercise = TRUE}
# calculate undiscounted incremental costs and effects

```

```{r calc_res_undisc-hint-1}
"Total incremental effects and costs are obtained by calculating the sum of each column."
```

```{r calc_res_undisc-hint-2}
"Use the sum() or colSums() function."
```

```{r calc_res_undisc-solution}
colSums(df_thx[, c(2:ncol(df_thx))])

## alternative: c(sum(df_thx[, "Inc_cost_A"]), sum(df_thx[, "Inc_QALY_A"]), sum(df_thx[, "Inc_cost_B"]), 
##                sum(df_thx[, "Inc_QALY_B"]), sum(df_thx[, "Inc_cost_C"]), sum(df_thx[, "Inc_QALY_C"]))
```

### Question
The correct undiscounted results are provided below (you can use these results to check your answer).
```{r show_totals_undisc}
df <- data.frame(
  Outcome = c("Incremental costs Intervention A", "Incremental QALYs Intervention A", "Incremental costs  Intervention B", "Incremental QALYs B", "Incremental costs Intervention C", "Incremental QALYs Intervention C"),
  Value = unname(colSums(df_thx[, c(2:ncol(df_thx))]))
)
df
rm(df)
```
```{r undisc_incrementals}
quiz(
question("Based on these results, which intervention provides the most health benefits in terms of QALYs?",
  answer("A"),
  answer("B"),
  answer("C"),
  answer("They all provide the same amount of health benefits", correct = TRUE)
),
question("Based on these results, which intervention costs the most?",
  answer("A"),
  answer("B"),
  answer("C"),
  answer("They all cost the same", correct = TRUE)
)
)
```

### Explanation answers
As can be seen in the table above, there are no differences concerning the UNDISCOUNTED incremental costs (`r paste("\u20ac", sum(df_thx[, 2]))`) and effects (`r sum(df_thx[, 3])` QALYs) between the different interventions. 

### Undiscounted ICERs
Calculate the **undiscounted** ICERS for each of these interventions using the total incremental costs and effects you calculated in the previous step, or using the original `df_thx` object. Suggestion: store the results in the `v_icer_undisc` for instance. The `t_inc_c_` and `t_inc_qaly_` respectively contain the total **undiscounted** incremental costs and QALYs of each strategy.

```{r cacl_icer_undisc, exercise = TRUE}
t_inc_c_A     <- sum(df_thx$Inc_cost_A) # total undiscounted incremental costs of strategy A
t_inc_qaly_A  <- sum(df_thx$Inc_QALY_A) # total undiscounted incremental QALYs of strategy A
t_inc_c_B     <- sum(df_thx$Inc_cost_B) # total undiscounted incremental costs of strategy B
t_inc_qaly_B  <- sum(df_thx$Inc_QALY_B) # total undiscounted incremental QBLYs of strategy B
t_inc_c_C     <- sum(df_thx$Inc_cost_C) # total undiscounted incremental costs of strategy C
t_inc_qaly_C  <- sum(df_thx$Inc_QALY_C) # total undiscounted incremental QCLYs of strategy C

# calculate undiscounted ICERs

```

```{r cacl_icer_undisc-hint}
"To calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), you have to divide total incremental costs by the total incremental effects for each intervention separately."
```

```{r cacl_icer_undisc-solution}
t_inc_c_A     <- sum(df_thx$Inc_cost_A) # total undiscounted incremental costs of strategy A
t_inc_qaly_A  <- sum(df_thx$Inc_QALY_A) # total undiscounted incremental QALYs of strategy A
t_inc_c_B     <- sum(df_thx$Inc_cost_B) # total undiscounted incremental costs of strategy B
t_inc_qaly_B  <- sum(df_thx$Inc_QALY_B) # total undiscounted incremental QBLYs of strategy B
t_inc_c_C     <- sum(df_thx$Inc_cost_C) # total undiscounted incremental costs of strategy C
t_inc_qaly_C  <- sum(df_thx$Inc_QALY_C) # total undiscounted incremental QCLYs of strategy C

v_icer_undisc <- c(ICER_A = t_inc_c_A/t_inc_qaly_A,
                   ICER_B = t_inc_c_B/t_inc_qaly_B,
                   ICER_C = t_inc_c_C/t_inc_qaly_C
)
```

### Question
The table below provides the ICERs for the different interventions. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
v_res_undisc <- colSums(df_thx[, c(2:ncol(df_thx))])
v_res_undisc <- unname(v_res_undisc) # removes names, for clarity
df_icer_undisc <- data.frame(ICER_A = format(v_res_undisc[1]/v_res_undisc[2], big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE),
                   ICER_B = format(v_res_undisc[3]/v_res_undisc[4], big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE),
                   ICER_C = format(v_res_undisc[5]/v_res_undisc[6], big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)
)
df_icer_undisc
```

```{r quest_icer_undisc}
question("Which intervention provides the best value for money (most favourable ICER) based on these **undiscounted** incremental costs and effects?",
  answer("A"),
  answer("B"),
  answer("C"),
  answer("None", correct = TRUE)
)
```

### Explanation answers
There are no differences concerning the **undiscounted** ICERs between the different interventions, because there are no differences between the **undiscounted** incremental costs and effects.  

## Discounted results  
First, define the discount weight as 5%, and call it `r_disc`. Use `r_disc` to create a vector of discount weights for Years 0 to 12, and save it as `v_disc`. Use the following formula to determine the discount weights:  $$w_i = \frac{1} {(1+r)^{t_i}}$$ where $w_i$ is the discount weight in year $i$, $r$ the discount rate, and $t_i$ year $i$.  

```{r create_v_disc, exercise = TRUE}
# define r_disc
r_disc
# define v_disc
v_disc
```

```{r create_v_disc-solution}
r_disc <- 0.05
v_disc <- 1/(1 + r_disc) ^ df_thx$Year
```

### Vector of discount weights
The following table and figure show how the discount weights changes over the years (correct code and answer).

```{r plot_v_disc, context = "render", echo = FALSE}
numericInput("r_disc1", "Discount rate", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.05)
plotOutput("plot_v_disc")
```

```{r plot_v_disc_serv, context = "server", echo = FALSE}

output$plot_v_disc <- renderPlot({
  
  v_disc <- 1/(1 + input$r_disc1) ^ c(1:50) # create vector of discount weights
  
  plot(v_disc, type = 'l',
     xlab = "Time (in years)",
     ylab = "Discount weight",
     ylim = c(0,1),
     xlim = c(0, 50))
})
```

### Questions
```{r quest_v_disc}
question("Please select how and why the discount weights change over time",
  answer("The discount weights increase over time, meaning that the present value of future costs and effects increases over time"),
  answer("The discount weights increase over time, meaning that the present value of future costs and effects decreases over time"),
  answer("The discount weights decrease over time, meaning that the present value of future costs and effects decreases over time ", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The discount weights decrease over time, meaning that the present value of future costs and effects increases over time")
)
```

Now increase the discount rate to 20% (0.2) and decrease it to 1% (0.01) in the graph above using the user-defined field under **Discount rate**.  
Can you explain what happens with the discount weight over time? Can you explain what it means for the discounted costs and effects?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
textInput("Answer_0", "Enter your answer")
```

### Explanations
When increasing the discount rate, the discount weights decrease faster over time, meaning that the costs and effects occuring in the future will be more heavily discounted (will be worth "less"). The opposite happens when we decrease the discount rate, the future costs and effects will be less heavily discounted (meaning that their current value increases compared when a higher discount rate is used).  

### Discount costs and effects
Apply discounting on the incremental effects and costs to convert them to their present value. Assign the discounted effects and costs to new columns of `df_thx` called `Inc_cost_A_d`, `Inc_QALY_A_d`, `Inc_cost_B_d`, `Inc_QALY_B_d`, `Inc_cost_C_d`, `Inc_QALY_C_d`.  You can use the vector `v_disc` (defined in the previous code chunk) to do so.  

```{r setup_disc_calc, include = FALSE}
r_disc <- 0.05
v_disc <- 1/(1 + r_disc) ^ df_thx$Year # create vector of discount weights
```

```{r calc_disc_inc, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "setup_disc_calc"}
# define df_thx$Inc_cost_A_d, df_thx$Inc_QALY_A_d, ...
```

```{r calc_disc_inc-hint}
"Multiply each column by the vector of discount weights to calculate discounted outcomes."
```

```{r calc_disc_inc-solution}
df_thx$Inc_cost_A_d <- df_thx$Inc_cost_A * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_QALY_A_d <- df_thx$Inc_QALY_A * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_cost_B_d <- df_thx$Inc_cost_B * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_QALY_B_d <- df_thx$Inc_QALY_B * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_cost_C_d <- df_thx$Inc_cost_C * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_QALY_C_d <- df_thx$Inc_QALY_C * v_disc
```

```{r setup_t_disc_calc, include = FALSE}
r_disc <- 0.05
v_disc <- 1/(1 + r_disc) ^ df_thx$Year # create vector of discount weights

df_thx$Inc_cost_A_d <- df_thx$Inc_cost_A * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_QALY_A_d <- df_thx$Inc_QALY_A * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_cost_B_d <- df_thx$Inc_cost_B * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_QALY_B_d <- df_thx$Inc_QALY_B * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_cost_C_d <- df_thx$Inc_cost_C * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_QALY_C_d <- df_thx$Inc_QALY_C * v_disc
```

### Calculate total discounted costs, effects, and ICERs
Calculate the total **discounted** incremental costs and effects, and ICERs for each intervention. Store the results in the below-described objects. For your convenience, the columns `Inc_cost_A_d`, `Inc_QALY_A_d`, `Inc_cost_B_d`, `Inc_QALY_B_d`, `Inc_cost_C_d`, `Inc_QALY_C_d` have been added to `df_thx`.

```{r calc_res_disc, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "setup_t_disc_calc"}
t_inc_c_d_A # total incremental discounted costs of strategy A
t_inc_qaly_d_A # total incremental discounted QALYs of strategy A
t_inc_c_d_B # total incremental discounted costs of strategy B
t_inc_qaly_d_B # total incremental discounted QALYs of strategy B
t_inc_c_d_C # total incremental discounted costs of strategy C
t_inc_qaly_d_C # total incremental discounted QALYs of strategy C

icer_d_A # ICER of A versus usual care using discounted costs and effects
icer_d_B # ICER of B versus usual care using discounted costs and effects
icer_d_C # ICER of C versus usual care using discounted costs and effects
```

```{r calc_res_disc-solution}
t_inc_c_d_A <- sum(df_thx$Inc_cost_A_d)
t_inc_qaly_d_A <- sum(df_thx$Inc_QALY_A_d)
t_inc_c_d_B <- sum(df_thx$Inc_cost_B_d)
t_inc_qaly_d_B <- sum(df_thx$Inc_QALY_B_d)
t_inc_c_d_C <- sum(df_thx$Inc_cost_C_d)
t_inc_qaly_d_C <- sum(df_thx$Inc_QALY_C_d)

icer_d_A <- t_inc_c_d_A / t_inc_qaly_d_A
icer_d_B <- t_inc_c_d_B / t_inc_qaly_d_B
icer_d_C <- t_inc_c_d_C / t_inc_qaly_d_C
```

### Questions
The **discounted** results should be the following.
```{r show_res_disc}
r_disc <- 0.05
v_disc <- 1/(1 + r_disc) ^ df_thx$Year # create vector of discount weights

df_thx$Inc_cost_A_d <- df_thx$Inc_cost_A * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_QALY_A_d <- df_thx$Inc_QALY_A * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_cost_B_d <- df_thx$Inc_cost_B * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_QALY_B_d <- df_thx$Inc_QALY_B * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_cost_C_d <- df_thx$Inc_cost_C * v_disc
df_thx$Inc_QALY_C_d <- df_thx$Inc_QALY_C * v_disc

v_res_disc <- colSums(df_thx[, c("Inc_cost_A_d", "Inc_QALY_A_d",
                                 "Inc_cost_B_d", "Inc_QALY_B_d",
                                 "Inc_cost_C_d", "Inc_QALY_C_d")]) # calculate totals - discounted
v_res_disc <- unname(v_res_disc) # [OPTIONAL]: remove names

v_icer_disc <- c(ICER_A = v_res_disc[1]/v_res_disc[2],
                   ICER_B = v_res_disc[3]/v_res_disc[4],
                   ICER_C = v_res_disc[5]/v_res_disc[6]
) 
df <- data.frame(
  Outcome = c("Incremental costs Intervention A", "Incremental QALYs Intervention A", "Incremental costs  Intervention B", "Incremental QALYs B", "Incremental costs Intervention C", "Incremental QALYs Intervention C"),
  Value = format(round(v_res_disc, 2), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)
)
df
v_icer_disc
```

```{r quest_disc}
quiz(
  question("Based on these results, which intervention provides the most health benefits in terms of QALYs?",
  answer("A", correct = TRUE),
  answer("B"),
  answer("C"),
  answer("None")
),
question("Based on these results, which intervention costs the most?",
  answer("A", correct = TRUE),
  answer("B", correct = TRUE),
  answer("C"),
  answer("None")
),
  question("Which intervention provides the best value for money (most favourable ICER) based on these **undiscounted** incremental costs and effects?",
  answer("A", correct = TRUE),
  answer("B"),
  answer("C"),
  answer("None")
)
)
```

### Explanations
The discounted incremental costs of A and B are equal and remain higher than discounted incremental costs of C. Intervention A provides the highest discounted incremental effects followed by C and B. The discounted ICER of intervention A is the lowest (best value for money), followed by C and then B.  

### Follow-up question
```{r quest_disc_diff}
question("Can you explain the difference between the undiscounted and discounted results? ",
  answer("All ICERs, calculated based on discounted costs and effects, increase because the health effects of all interventions are more heavily discounted than the costs because the incremental effects occurs later in the future than the costs. Hence, their present value is more heavily discounted than the incremental costs, and the ICERs increase.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("All ICERs, calculated based on discounted costs and effects, increase because the health effects of all interventions are less heavily discounted than the costs because the incremental effects occurs later in the future than the costs. Hence, their present value is less heavily discounted than the incremental costs, and the ICERs increase.")
)
```

## Changing the discount rate
The following graph shows both the undiscounted results and discounted results for all three interventions, based on a user-defined discount rate. Answer the questions below by changing the discount rate appropriately. The default value is 5% (0.05) as in the exercises above.    
```{r plot_disc, context = "render", echo = FALSE}
numericInput("r_disc", "Discount rate", min = 0, max = 1, value = 0.05)

                   ICER_C = v_res_disc[5]/v_res_disc[6]
) # calculate discounted ICERs, with 10% discount rate

# Comparison all results
m_res_total <- rbind(v_icer_undisc,
                   v_icer_disc)

df_res <- data.frame(cbind(Analysis = c("Undiscounted", "Discounted")),
                     m_res_total)
df_plot <- df_res %>% 
    tidyr::pivot_longer(c(ICER_A, ICER_B, ICER_C), names_to = "Intervention", values_to = "ICER")

# Plot
 plot_res <- ggplot(data = df_plot, aes(x = Intervention, y = ICER, fill = Analysis)) +
   geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) + 
   #ylim(0, 60000) +
   theme_bw()
 
 plot_res
})
```

### Questions
```{r quest_disc_alt}
question("Now apply a discount rate of 15% (0.15)  using the graph above. Which intervention provides the most value for money based on the discounted results?",
         answer("A", correct = TRUE),
         answer("B"), 
         answer("C"),
         answer("None")
)
```

A. Can you explain these results? Are these comparable with results obtained the previous step?  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
textInput("Answer_A", "Enter your answer")
```

B. Can you explain why, even with a small discount rate (for example 0.1%), the cost-effectiveness with discounting is always worse than cost-effectiveness without discounting for these three strategies? 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
textInput("Answer_B", "Enter your answer")
```

### Explanations
A. The effect observed in the previous step is only reinforced due to the higher yearly discount rate. Changing the discount rate does not change the order (in terms of ICER) of the interventions.  
B. For all three programmes, costs are incurred earlier (in earlier years) than health benefits are gained. Consequently, when future costs and future effects are discounted, the present value of health effects decreases more than the present value of costs. Given that health benefits are discounted more heavily than than costs, the cost-effectiveness deteriorates (the ICERs go up) whenever any discount rate >0 % is applied.  

**THE END**
